I arrive at Ben Gurion airport, my ass hurting from sitting nearly 18 hours and not having any sleep in the past 36. It was a rough ride, but after 3 years of anticipation and waiting, I’m in Israel.

## My Experience in Israel and Palestine

My freshman year of college, I found out about an opportunity for a nearly all-expense-paid trip to Israel. January 2020, the director of the Mizzou Hillel (Jewish student organization) came in to tell my class about a so-called “perspectives” trip seeking a diverse cohort of students. Her proposal hooked me, and I completed the application that night. A week later, I’m interviewed. Then, I get the news… I’m an alternate for the trip. If someone can’t make it, I’ll be the one to take their place. Well, that sucks, but hey, you win some you lose some, right? Yes… but then COVID happened.

Israel locked its borders and so did pretty much everywhere else in the world. The group responsible for the trip put it on hold and waited for the pandemic to pass. My sophomore year, the director informed me that due to people graduating, I was guaranteed a spot on the trip (I was also a better candidate for the trip because I switched my degree from journalism to religious studies). The new date for the trip was summer 2021. Then Israel kept its borders shut and the new date was winter 2021. Then omicron. Then finally, Israel opened its borders, COVID calmed down, and the date was set for summer 2022. Given my past experiences, I wasn’t sure it was going to happen, but it finally did. I feel like one of the only people in the world who benefitted from COVID (not just regarding this trip but in several ways beyond the purview of this blog post).

Being in Ben Gurion airport felt like a dream at first. As the plane landed, I saw Tel Aviv’s beautiful skyline, and I couldn’t believe I was in Israel. I waited so long for this trip, unsure if it would ever happen, but yet I was in the Holy Land. After going through customs, I withdrew shekels from an ATM (shout out to my bank and their amazing international policy). The dream-like nature wore off as I held the shekels in my hand, and I walked toward my group’s bus. For the next two hours, I fought sleep so I could take in all of the sights as the bus took my group towards our hotel on the Sea of Galilee. Staying awake proved difficult, but I managed to see the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Israel’s beautiful countryside.

Just before our trip, Israel removed its PCR test requirement for people entering the country. The plan was to wait for the group to receive test results and have a night in at the hotel. Given the short notice of the policy change, we still ended up just chilling, but it did mean we could go and explore the area around the hotel. Some of the group went to see the Sea, but after dinner all I wanted to do was sleep. After calling my mom and letting her know I made it to the hotel, I laid down in my bed. Literally, a few seconds later Mr. Sandman knocked me out.

Our first real day in Israel began with a lecture from an Israeli journalist. As a recovering journalism student, I found it interesting, but I wanted to get into the more exciting stuff. That more exciting stuff involved going to the Golan Heights (Syrian territory technically occupied by Israel) and taking a Jeep tour. As a rollercoaster lover, I loved the Jeep tour. There were times when we were almost 90 degrees driving up and down the mountains. Then, at the end of the tour, we explored an old military bunker and climbed on top of a tank—in a word, badass (also, fun fact, apparently there was a military operation near where we were standing on the border literally the day after we were there). After the Jeep tour and geopolitical lesson on the Golan Heights, we went to a Druze village where a local woman fed us an amazing lunch and explained Druze culture. I knew of Druze people before the trip, but it was interesting to hear from a Druze person first-hand.

The discussion with the Druze woman also introduced one of the primary themes of the trip: conflicting narratives. Because the Golan Heights are technically Syrian territory that Israel occupies, many of the citizens there are pseudo-stateless. Israel gives them the option to become Israeli citizens, but many choose to forgo it to maintain connections with their Syrian families. However, given Syria’s current state, it’s doubtful the Golan Heights will ever return to its hands. Is that the right solution? I honestly don’t know. Maybe if Bashar al-Assad is driven from power and Syria is able to become a democratic state, the Golan Heights can return to their purview, but right now, I don’t think returning the land to Syria is an option.

![Abandoned tank in the Golan Heights]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/golan_heights_tank.jpeg" | relative_url}})

We went back to the hotel and participated in a panel with 3 Arab Israelis who offered their perspective on being Arab in Israel. One person was a Druze, one person was a Palestinian, and one person was Lebanese. All talked about the positive and negative aspects of being Arab Israeli. They offered a nuanced view, and it helped me realize the conflict in Israel is so much more complex than I (and many Americans) realize. After the panel, I ate dinner and went to bed. As an aside, one of the weird things about the trip was that I never remembered my dreams. Usually, I can recall a dream when I wake up, but that wasn’t the case in Israel.

In the morning I went down the dock next to the hotel and took in the beauty of the Sea of Galilee. Not to sound cliché, but it was truly stunning. Israel is a beautiful country, and it’s beautiful in so many ways. The Sea of Galilee expands out, its deep blue water blending into the sky at the horizon. Mountains tower over it, and it made me feel like a piece of meat in a bowl of soup. I know that’s a weird simile, but like that’s literally what it looks like! Anyway, I went to breakfast and ate shakshuka for the first time. This is where my beef with Israeli food begins. I do not know what it is, but I think the Israeli people under-salt their food. The shakshuka was good, but it benefitted from a vigorous shaking of table salt. Before I added in the flavor enhancement, it tasted bland—which is not what I was expecting from a “spiced” egg and tomato dish. I will say that all of the pastries and desserts were amazing, however.

![Landscape picture of the Sea of Galilee]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/sea_of_galilee_landscape_2.jpeg" | relative_url}})

The group finished breakfast and it was time to leave our hotel. Next stop: several Christian holy sites around the Sea of Galilee. Our tour included Capernaum, a place where Jesus taught and Peter’s house is said to have been, Tabgha, the alleged site of the multiplication of the loaves and the fishes, the Mount of Beatitudes, the alleged site of the Sermon on the Mount, and finally Qasr el Yahud, where some Jews believe Joshua crossed the Jordan and where John the Baptist baptized Jesus. (Note: I say “alleged” because we can’t confirm the events that took place. I do not mean to say these things didn’t happen, just that we can’t be sure that they did, and that if they did, we can’t be sure the sites are actually where they happened.) At Qasr el Yahud, we looked into the border with Jordan, and saw some IDF guards “hard at work.” Like the rest of Israel, the area was beautiful, but the Jordan river looked like septic runoff (I still put my hands in it for funsies).

From Qasr el Yahud we went down to one of my favorite parts of the trip, the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea was not on the original itinerary, but our wonderful tour guide pulled some strings, and we got a pretty good amount of time there. I rubbed myself in the famous mud, and then I walked in. The Dead Sea is so salty that it’s impossible to not float. As a human, you’re so much less dense than the water that it force your body up. It’s a surreal experience, especially for someone like me who is not at all buoyant (I can’t swim, but I was doing backstrokes in the Dead Sea). Now, to be clear, I think a lot of the special properties of the Dead Sea mud are overstated and reminiscent of snake oil salesman tropes, but I can’t deny that afterward, my skin felt amazing. Throughout the day I kept rubbing myself because my skin was so soft; it felt like those overpriced 1000 thread count sheets. After exiting the Dead Sea and taking a shower, I paid way too much for an ice cream bar. I acknowledge this, but I still contend that it was the best ice cream bar I’ve ever had. It was 95 degrees at the Dead Sea, and I did not drink enough water. The coolness of the ice cream bar sent me into a state of euphoria, and that experience is priceless. Unfortunately, I had another issue, and mud nor ice cream could solve it.

Before the trip, I received treatment for an infected tooth. This happened a week before the trip, and there was no way I could get to an oral surgeon in time for a root canal. The infection returned while I was in Israel, so I had to go to the dentist (along with another person from our group). After the group finished at the Dead Sea, we boarded the bus and started towards Jerusalem. The bus dropped the person, the trip supervisor, and me off at the dentist, and everyone else began a tour the Old City. We spent most of our time waiting in the lobby, occasionally interrupted by the receptionist trying to figure out insurance information. Pro tip for anyone traveling to Israel: while many of the people speak English, fluency varies. If you plan on going to the hospital or dentist, having a little Hebrew under your belt will help. Finally, the dentist called us in and prescribed both of us antibiotics. We left the office and headed to a Super-Pharm (Israel’s CVS and Walgreens equivalent) that was on the way to a spot where we could meet up with the rest of the group. In total, I paid $80 (240-ish shekels) for the visit, antibiotics, and ibuprofen. For me and my great dental insurance, that’s expensive, but I think for someone with no insurance in the US, it’d be a bargain (though I’m not actually sure).

We met up with the group as the tour guide stood in front of an old Roman map and explained the decisions the Romans made when mapping the Old City. From there we walked onto a rooftop and got a sweeping view of Jerusalem and the surrounding landscape. Again, Israel stunned me with its beauty. I’m by no means a world traveler (this trip is my first and only international excursion), but I can say with certainty that Israel is the most scenic place I’ve ever been. I think all of the Western states in the US are beautiful, but they don’t hold a candle to Israel and Palestine. On the rooftop, we saw the gold top of the Dome of the Rock, which we would head to a couple of days later. After some time for pictures, we went back down to street level and walked to the Western Wall. The Western Wall is considered one of the holiest places in Judaism because it’s one of the only remaining vestiges of the Second Temple. Many Jewish people go there to pray, and when our group arrived, there were at least a thousand people at the Wall. I picked up a yarmulke (which the wind quickly whisked off my head) and joined the mass of people. I’m not religious, so I didn’t feel a special connection to the Wall, but I placed my hand on it and enjoyed the warmth it radiated. No matter religious affiliation (or lack thereof), placing your hand on the wall and joining thousands of others is a special moment. The Wall was our last stop for the day, so we took the bus to the hotel and checked in to the place where we would spend the next five nights.

I woke up that morning excited for the day’s agenda. We were getting to go into Palestine. Visiting Palestine was one of my main reasons for wanting to go on the trip, as I am sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. Our first stop was Ramallah, where we got to meet with a top-level diplomat for the Palestinian Authority. She told us about her conversations with George Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, and gave a Palestinian perspective on America’s involvement and the general state of the conflict. I liked her, but you could tell she was a politician. Sometimes she gave vague answers to questions from the group. She focused on the two-state solution but failed to specify how Palestine would prevent Hamas from taking over, and how the PA would fight corruption within its ranks. She gave a rose-tinted view of the conflict, and I couldn’t help but feel the PA in its current state isn’t prepared for independence. I came into the trip a firm supporter of the two-state solution, but the session with the PA diplomat started me on a road towards disillusion.

We only spent a short time in Ramallah due to safety concerns, but from the bus window, I saw all of the makings of a modern city and of a struggling city. Skyscrapers made for a beautiful skyline, but they stood next to dilapidated buildings with water tanks on the roof. BMWs drove next to Toyotas from the 90s. The wealth inequality was obvious, and I assume the PA focused on building infrastructure projects to distract from the horrible living conditions of normal Palestinians. After our brief stop in Ramallah, we took the bus to Rawabi, which is a fever dream of a city.

![Skyscrapers in Ramallah]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/ramallah.jpeg" | relative_url}})

So, for those unaware, Rawabi is a city that was completely designed before being built. All of the buildings are designed in a pseudo-brutalism vain, and they tower over the landscape. Everything about the city feels artificial, and our group speculated on several conspiracy theories. While in Rawabi we had lunch with the lead designer, and the way people treated him only added to the eeriness of it all. He had a person bring him coffee like they were his servant, and he just had a very weird aura about him. He viewed Rawabi as the future of Palestine, but Rawabi only happened because Qatar funneled millions of dollars into it (this led to us believing it’s actually a Qatari satellite city). The city center resembled a Q-shape, and the developer said the Q stands for Qatar. Again, just really weird vibes. Many people on the trip agreed it felt like we were in some weird dystopia or on the set of something akin to The Truman Show. Bad vibes aside, it was cool to see a completely pre-planned city. As an enjoyer of Cities: Skylines, I found hearing about the city-building process interesting.

Next on the itinerary was a visit to Taybeh Brewery, the first microbrewery in Palestine. When I received the itinerary a couple of weeks before the trip, I had mixed feelings about visiting a brewery. I figured it’d be neat, but I absolutely hate beer. Beer is one of the most disgusting things on planet Earth, and I felt that maybe we could spend time at a more interesting place. After visiting the brewery, I changed my mind. Hearing about the logistics of shipping out of Palestine offered a new way of thinking about how Israel strangles Palestine with its occupation. It’s not something I heard about in the States, but it’s a big deal for people trying to build businesses in the West Bank. There are so many unnecessary hoops to jump through that Israel justifies as “security measures.” Trucks from Palestine can’t cross the border, so the cargo in them has to be unpacked and repacked into a new truck. Then, even though IDF soldiers supervised the unpacking and packing, the new truck still has to go through several security checks before the product can leave Israel. It’s all a bit arbitrary and one of the clearer examples of Israel’s apartheid policies. That makes the stop sound kind of gloomy and dull, but beyond that, it was really enjoyable! The beer wasn’t repulsive, and I loved learning about the brewing process. I bought a bottle of rosé, and it was very good. According to the people who bought the beer, all of the selections were great.

Taybeh was our last stop for the day, so it was time to go back to our hotel in Jerusalem. While there, we had a session with another Israeli journalist who explained the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the perspective of the average Israeli. He made an effective argument, but I disagreed with some of what he said. First, he claimed voter turnout is related to faith in the electoral system. I partially agree, but I also disagree. In America, the reason our voter turnout is low compared to most other countries is very complicated. There are several reasons why people don’t vote, from our primary system, to the electoral college, to some people just being lazy. To boil it down to “faith in the electoral process” is an oversimplification (he also got turnout numbers completely wrong). I don’t know about Israel’s politics, but I’m also going to assume voter turnout is more complicated than that. He also claimed that most Israelis are refugees escaping persecution. While that is true for a lot of Israelis, you can’t ignore that a lot of the Israeli population is made of White Jewish people who moved from a Western country. The “refugee” statement was also something our tour guide, an immigrant to Israel from Canada, disagreed with. I enjoyed listening to him, and I think overall he gave a good overview of what the average Israeli thinks, I just took a lot of what he said with a grain of salt. His perspective also provided a nice contrast with the Palestinian perspectives that were the primary focus of the day.

After our session with the Israeli journalist, we had a good amount of free time, so a friend and I went to the only gay bar in Jerusalem and had an amazing night. The bartender was so friendly, and I ended up spending way too many shekels on drinks. It was worth it though. I got a nice buzz, danced with some gay men, and screamed Lady Gaga songs. That night is a definite highlight, and I hope I get to repeat it in the future. My friend and I got back to the hotel, exhausted but jovial. Again, I lay in bed and fell asleep within minutes. I have pretty bad insomnia, but it seems I found a cure in international travel.

The next day was another day in Palestine, but first, we went to the Temple Mount. While there, we saw police guiding a group of Jewish people. Our guide told us the police were there to prevent harassment from paid instigators and reduce tensions. I’m not sure how true that is, but I do believe Jewish people should be allowed to visit the Temple Mount without worrying about harassment. The Temple Mount is holy to both Muslims and Jews, and anyone should be allowed on it without fear of confrontation. The Temple Mount houses the Dome of the Rock, and up close mosaic tiles and gold roof reflect the sun’s rays like a holy disco ball. It’s an amazing piece of architecture, and I wish I could’ve gone in. Alas, I’m not Muslim, and I understand the Dome of the Rock is a special place for only Muslims. I understand, but I’m still bummed out.

![Close-up picture of the Dome of the Rock]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/al-aqsa_temple-mount.jpeg" | relative_url}})

After visiting some of the holiest sites for Jews and Muslims, it was Christianity’s time to shine. We rode the bus into Bethlehem, where we got to see the wall of many names. Officially it’s the Seam Zone Barrier but depending on your perspective it could be the Security Wall or the Apartheid Wall. I’ll call it the Apartheid Wall because it’s another symbol of Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. The Apartheid Wall acts as a visual reminder that Palestinians aren’t a part of Israeli society. To further drive the point home, the Wall encircles Rachel’s Tomb (Old Testament matriarch) so only Jews are allowed in—even though Rachel’s Tomb is important to both Jews and Muslims and is internationally recognized as Palestinian territory. Graffiti covers the Palestinian side of the wall, and I couldn’t help but think of the Berlin Wall as we walked alongside it. I believe the Apartheid Wall will come down, and that when it comes down it will be my generation’s Berlin Wall.

![A drawing of a sheep holding a Palestinian flag on the Apartheid Wall]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/sheep_apartheid-wall.jpeg" | relative_url}})

Our Palestinian guide then took us through downtown Bethlehem towards the Church of the Nativity. In the basement of the church are the alleged spot of Jesus’s birth and the famous manger where he spent his first few moments of life. I appreciated having the opportunity to look at these places, but there were too many people crowding the Church, and I just wanted to get out. I took some pictures and found a place to the side so I could take a breather. The whole experience highlighted how my lack of religion influenced my viewpoint. Like sure, these places are (potentially) historically significant, but due to a lack of spiritual connection, it was like visiting any other historic landmark (with the added caveat that the history may be completely wrong).

After completing our visit to the Church, we had a session with our tour guide of the day. He offered another Palestinian perspective, and it shocked me. Up to that point, the Palestinians we talked to wanted a two-state solution, but this guide thought the only solution is a one-state solution. He explained that given the Jewish settlements, the threat of Hamas, and the failure of the PA to govern, a completely independent Palestine isn’t feasible. There are several ways a one-state solution could happen, but the one the guide explained operated on similar principles to the European Union. Basically, Israel and Palestine would operate as separate members of a single confederation, with Jerusalem considered an international city. Palestinians and Israelis would have free movement, but they would vote in their own elections. As for security, Palestine and Israel could operate jointly, working to counter threats from Hamas. It’s far from perfect, but it’s the most comprehensive solution presented during the trip. His perspective also influenced my thinking. It fully converted me from being pro-two-state to pro-one-state.

After the session, we said goodbye to our Palestinian guide and made the drive back to Jerusalem. We had a quick stop in East Jerusalem where we met with an East Jerusalemite teacher. He gave the perspective of someone who took Israel’s offer of citizenship while still acknowledging Israel illegally occupied East Jerusalem. He made it clear that for him, taking on Israeli citizenship was the best option even if it wasn’t the most desirable. Now he seeks to build dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, and he hopes conversations and meetings between Israelis and Palestinians can lay the foundation for further cooperation. He doesn’t believe there will ever be a full solution to the conflict, but that there can be less fighting because of it. At first, I thought it was a very cynical take, but he explained it was optimistic. The status quo continuing means nothing is going to collapse. After the session, our group headed back to the hotel. This day felt like one of the longest, and after dinner, I went up to my room and collapsed into my bed.

I awoke feeling very well rested with a whole 10 hours of sleep under my belt. Today was going to be one of the hardest days of the trip; it was the day of our visit to Yad Vashem, Israel’s national Holocaust memorial. We started with a talk given by a Jewish scholar whose parents survived the Holocaust. She explained how Yad Vashem was completely redesigned in 2005 to rework the narrative. In the wake of the Holocaust, the Jewish people felt a great sense of guilt. They wondered how God could let something like this happen to them, and that attitude influenced the original Yad Vashem. Later, their descendants wanted to change that guilt-filled narrative into one that recognized the Jews as victims. I appreciated having this context, and it made the museum experience more enriching.

The museum itself is wonderfully built. All of its design is focused on telling the story of the Holocaust. We had a guided tour, and while I normally resent guided tours of museums, our museum guide did a great job. My only complaint is that I wish we had more time—2 hours was not nearly enough. 5 hours wouldn’t be enough. Given the time constraints, I think the guide did a great job before we reached the end of the museum. What was surprising about the end is how optimistic it was. The exit of the museum leads to a balcony with a picturesque view of the Israeli landscape, and it reminds visitors why Israel exists at all.

Israel was an idea decades before the Holocaust, but the Holocaust solidified the need for its existence. Israel is a safe place Jews can go to when no other country will let them in. Several Jews tried to escape Germany before they were sent to the death and concentration camps, but other countries rarely let them in. Even if they were let in, many of those countries were later taken over by Nazi Germany. Israel is a promise to Jews that they will have a place to go. I wouldn’t consider myself a Zionist by any stretch but visiting Yad Vashem helped me realize the necessity of a Jewish state.

After completing our tour of Yad Vashem, we visited the Israeli National Cemetery. There our guide showed us the graves of a couple of his friends who died in combat. I’m a pretty emotional person, so hearing him tell stories and his voice crack made me shed a few tears. Over here in the US, it’s easy to demonize Israelis and the people serving in the IDF, but in doing so we forget their humanity. Most Israelis want peaceful relations with Palestinians, but they’re also concerned for their own safety. Things change when rockets are destroying your local libraries and when air raid sirens go off while walking your kids to school. Americans cannot imagine the hardship and trauma of everyday Israelis, and one of my major takeaways from the trip is that until we can empathize with those hardships, we should shut up.

The rest of the day was filled with much lighter fare. We experienced the rush of the market before Shabbat (in Israel the Sabbath begins with sundown on Friday night), and I drank the worst chai tea ever. Afterward, we headed back to the hotel for a quick rest. I took a short nap, and it was the greatest nap I’ve ever taken. As Shabbat neared, we walked to a park close to our hotel and processed the day’s events. One of my peers talked about the guilt she felt because her family was Polish, and they likely were some of the people turning Jews over to the Nazis. It was powerful listening to her, and I’m so thankful she shared how her background shaped her perspective. The sun dipped lower in the sky, and the air raid sirens wailed, signaling the beginning of Shabbat.

Back at the hotel, we had a festive Shabbat dinner. It is probably my favorite night of the trip. Everyone got tipsy on wine and filled up on amazing food. After dinner, the revelry continued as we chilled and chatted in the lobby. Eventually, I had to retire for the night, but I wish I could’ve fought sleep just a little bit longer.

On the day of Shabbat, we focused on Christian sites in Jerusalem because everything else was closed. We went to the Christian Quarter and visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. In the Church are Calvary, one of Jesus’s alleged resting places, and the alleged location of where the cross was found. Like the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, it was cool and all, but I didn’t feel any connection to the sites beyond their historical significance. The crowd also spoiled enjoyment as well. We left the Church and had some free time to spend in the Arab and Christian markets, and I visited a lunch spot I ate at previously. The guy enjoyed seeing me again, and he tried to sell me some overpriced jewelry. I entertained him for a bit, but then I dipped once he tried getting me to actually buy stuff. The jewelry looked cool, but I’m not spending $100 on a cheap necklace. We had another night out as we got to see businesses opening, and I enjoyed the Israeli version of pizza. Honestly, it was pretty good, even though I tend to be a meat-lovers pizza kind of guy (kosher food can’t contain any pork and forbids mixing meat and dairy). It was a great way to spend my last night in Jerusalem, but I wish I would’ve went back to the hotel earlier because we had to wake up early for our trip to Tel Aviv tomorrow morning.

On too few hours of sleep, I went down to breakfast and ate shakshuka which was again underseasoned. Everyone loaded their luggage on the bus, and we hit the road. Before we stopped in Tel Aviv we visited an Ethiopian-Jewish community. For a quick history lesson, thousands of years ago a group of Jews went to Ethiopia, and they created new traditions in their new environment. Now, Ethiopian Jews are returning to Israel and bringing their new traditions. We participated in a special ceremony featuring bread and coffee, then we learned about Ethiopian-Jewish culture. This culminated in a wonderful dance party where one of the leaders of the community showed us some moves. I loved every second, even though sweat covered every inch of my skin by the end of the dance lesson.

After visiting the community, we still weren’t on our way to Tel Aviv. We made another stop in Sderot and visited a monument overlooking the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. On the horizon, we saw buildings, some of which were likely makeshift rocket silos. Every house in Sderot has a bomb shelter because when rockets start flying from Gaza, Sderot is one of their first targets. Another sobering reminder of the trauma of living in Israel. After our guide finished with the overlook, we went to a local restaurant and talked with some students studying cinema at the university in Sderot. We learned about what it’s like being a student in Israel all while enjoying some amazing hummus.

![Looking into the Gaza Strip]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/gaza-strip_landscape.jpeg" | relative_url}})

Then it was time for our final stop before Tel Aviv: a museum dedicated to the Jewish settlers forced out of Gaza. Before 2005, around 8000 Jewish settlers were living in the Gaza Strip. As part of Israel’s withdrawal from the area, the settlers were forced to move out. Before visiting the museum, I took a generally negative view of the settlement movement. Without a doubt the settlements are illegal, and they are part of Israel’s strategy to eat away at the West Bank. However, the settlers are there now, and those settlements are their homes. Whether they moved to a settlement because it was cheaper or because they believe in Israel’s right to rule Palestine, forcing them to move away would just be another act of trauma. Maybe, in the future, these settlements can act as the first sites of cooperation between a united Israel and Palestine. Maybe that’s too optimistic of a view. Either way, the settlements are there, and the removal of settlers from Gaza is something that should not be repeated with the West Bank. After we were done visiting the museum, we had a quick group session to discuss everything we saw so far, and then it was time to finally head to Tel Aviv.

Driving into Tel Aviv reminded me of driving into New York City. The suburbs give way to a beautiful skyline, and the traffic matches as well. Once we finally got into the city, our guide gave us a graffiti tour of the Florentine neighborhood. I saw so many rainbow flags, and I immediately fell in love. Jerusalem is cool and all, but Tel Aviv is my kind of city. After checking into the fanciest hotel (they gave us free champagne) I’ve ever stayed in, I walked around with one of my friends. We wanted to go to a bar, but unfortunately, there weren’t any good gay bars nearby, so we decided to walk around, buy some wine, and have a night in after we got dinner (at an amazing Ethiopian restaurant). That didn’t stop us from visiting a nearby sex shop, however, where the only thing stopping me from purchasing something was having to potentially explain it to US Customs.

![Graffiti depicting members of the 27 club]({{ "/assets/img/articles/israel/27-club_graffiti_wall.jpeg" | relative_url}})

After the night-in with my friend, I returned to my hotel room and experienced a luxury I didn’t know I missed: a bath. In our previous two hotels, there were only showers. This hotel had a large bathtub, and I spent like 30 minutes relaxing in it. I realized how much my body ached from the walking and dancing, and I almost fell asleep a couple of times. I know my roommates needed the bathroom too, so I got out of the bath and went to bed for my final night of rest in Israel.

The final morning in Jerusalem was another early one, but I was so exhausted from the previous day I barely woke up in time. All of the previous days I woke up for breakfast, but this day I woke up 10 minutes before I needed to get my luggage packed on the bus. It was a stressful start but looking back I’m glad I got the extra Z’s. Even though we were leaving that night, it was one of our busiest days. First, we went to Lod, one of only 8 mixed communities in Israel (meaning Arabs and Israelis make up at least 10% each of the population). There we learned how the city acted as a microcosm of the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Back in May 2021, when Hamas was firing rockets into Israel, tensions flared between the locals. We then heard perspectives from both Arab and Jewish residents, and what they were doing to mend relations between the two communities. One of the coolest things they told us was how they created a community women’s basketball team and then had to create another because the first one was so successful it was promoted to the national basketball league.

After Lod, we went back to Tel Aviv to hear from a Jewish and Muslim couple. They invited us into their home and the entire thing was adorable. The husband told the story of how he met his wife, and then he explained how he’s building relations between Jewish and Muslim people. His organization focuses on creating mixed preschools where Arab and Israeli children can interact and learn together. It is his hope this builds tolerance, and the new generation taught by these schools can find a solution to the conflict. I loved him, despite the fact that he called us wimps for wanting AC.

Next, we visited with another scholar. He used his session with us to explain Israel culturally, and why they can be such a happy nation when the cost of living is through the roof and a rocket could rain down at any time. Basically, he argues, it boils down to Israel’s roots as a socialist nation. They have an amazing healthcare system, basic needs are provided for, and while the conflict puts a downer on things, many people are optimistic that it’s getting better. He argues Israel is thriving and will continue to do so. It was a nice optimistic end to the trip, and I kept his email because I have so many questions for him.

When our session finished, dinner time neared. Before we went to the restaurant, we held a group meeting at the beach. After the meeting, we were given time to walk on the beach, and then we had an impromptu photo session. That’s when the bittersweet feeling started setting in for me. I loved Israel, and I loved the people joining me on the trip. I didn’t quite miss home, but I did miss my alone time, my air-conditioned apartment, and not having to wake up and go every day. I miss Israel, and I will be going back, but I’m also happy to be sleeping in my bed here in good ole Missouri.

Our time at the beach delayed our dinner, so we had to scarf it down in order to make our flight. When we arrived at the airport, it was unlike anything I’d ever seen. To put this in perspective, I’ve flown through O’Hare, LaGuardia, the Denver, the Las Vegas, and the Atlanta airports, some of the busiest airports in the world, but Ben Gurion was on another level. Because we were a group, we got special clearance to get through the gate, but it still took us an hour of waiting, and we didn’t arrive at the gate until 20 minutes before the plane began boarding. Despite the chaos, we all made it on the flight, and I got to once again experience the thrill of sitting in an uncomfortable seat for 12 hours while my ass ached.

Due to several epitomizations of Murphy’s Law, I arrived back in my hometown at 5 am. My queen bed rivaled the beauty of Israel’s landscape, and I took a much-needed rest. I woke up at noon, and I began unpacking everything. All of my clothes needed washing. I needed to catalog all of the items I planned on giving as gifts to friends. On the flight, I realized I lost my Verizon SIM card, so I also looked for that (unfortunately I probably lost it back in Israel). I also lost a couple of other items, including a crucifix I bought for a friend and my deodorant. Where these items went, I do not know, but none of them were major losses. Everything else was as it should be, and I stopped stressing. I finished washing my clothes and packed them back up for the trip up to my college apartment the next morning, concluding the trip’s epilogue.

## A New Perspective

As I mentioned previously, before the trip I believed in the two-state solution. I viewed Israel as an evil oppressor of the Palestinian people, and I verged on anti-Zionism. Now, I’ve pulled back from my negative views. I came back from the trip more pro-Palestinian… and more pro-Israeli. I use the demonyms instead of the countries’ names because both governments are problematic, and I’m focused on the people living under them. Both Palestinians and Israelis have a rightful claim to the land they live on, and that’s what makes the conflict so complex

There are no easy solutions here, and nothing is going to be a perfect fix. Ending the conflict will require acknowledging hard truths: Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal, but no one should suffer the trauma of losing their home; There needs to be a cooperative agreement on Jerusalem; Hamas is a terrorist organization, but they’re successful because they PA government is utterly inept. What makes the situation even worse is people in the United States pretending they understand the conflict and taking definite sides. I’m willing to bet most pro-Palestine leftists don’t realize Israel is rooted in socialist ideals they firmly believe in, and it’s a great example of those ideals in practice (also that 70% of Jews in the US identify with the Democratic party). Then on the other hand Palestine is a deeply conservative place with a huge amount of wealth inequality and a failing government. I’m willing to bet most pro-Israel rightists don’t realize the only reason most conservative leaders in the US support Israel is because it’s a strategic ally. The US government doesn’t care about a Jewish state, they just want a base of operations close to Iran.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a political conflict, but it’s also a religious and personal conflict. The trip I went on was focused on explaining the conflict from multiple perspectives, and I left feeling more unsure and confused about the situation than when the trip began! The whole thing, to borrow a word from the Israelis, is a בלגן (balagan, basically meaning a shitshow)!

For my leftist, pro-Palestine friends, this conflict won’t be solved by pro-Palestine campus organizations or BDS movements (which often hurt Palestinians and are vectors for antiSemitism). Many Israelis are there because they are refugees or the descendants of refugees. For those that aren’t, they have a right to return to their ancestral homeland. Also, it’s important to acknowledge the symbol Israel provides to other Jews: ‘This is a place where you are always welcome.’ Another important considerations is that there’s no way Palestine can be a fully independent state right now. Its government is corrupt and ineffectual, and there’s a real risk of Hamas taking over. Hamas is popular because they provided services when the PA wouldn’t, but they’re still a terrorist organization.

For the pro-Israelis on the right (I know none of you are my friends), Palestine has just as much of a right to exist as Israel. They both have legitimate claims to the land. It doesn’t matter if the Jews were there first thousands of years ago… that was thousands of years ago. We’re living in the present where both Palestinians and Israelis have been living on the land for centuries. Also, Israel isn’t perfect. Its settlements in the West Bank are illegal, and they are meant to infringe on the right to the land Palestine has under international law. Finally, I’m sure you care about Jewish people, but your leaders don’t. Why else would they tacitly allow the White Supremacists and antiSemites in their ranks?

I think the best solution moving forward is the one-state confederation mentioned earlier in this post, but I also acknowledge my opinion literally doesn’t matter. I’m not an Israeli with Hamas rockets flying over my head while I walk my children to school, and I’m not a Palestinian who lives under Israel’s system of apartheid (which is what it is—you need to call a spade a spade; Israel’s right to exist isn’t a right to oppression). The solution can only come from the Israelis and Palestinians working together, and that’s what makes me hopeful. There are so many efforts now to bring Israelis and Palestinians together, and I think the increased dialogue between them will lead to lasting, positive change. As the Berlin Wall was to my parent’s generation, the Apartheid Wall will be to my generation. A new generation will come into power and break down the physical and figurative barriers between Israelis and Palestinians so that they can then raise a generation that knows no separation, only cooperation.
