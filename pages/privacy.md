## Introduction

As a privacy-minded person myself, I want to ensure the maximum privacy I can for anyone who uses my site. That means, you are free to opt out of almost everything on this site. I will delve later into mandatory cookies, but aside from those, everything else it totally optional. This privacy policy is designed to protect and inform you. It will detail your rights as a consumer of the Brandon's Void website.

This privacy policy applies to all links and subdomains of the Brandon's Void website (https://brandonsvoid.com). Any time I refer to the site, I am referring to the Brandoin's Void website and all its links and subdomains. When I use first-person terms such as "I" or "me," I am referring to myself, Brandon Ford, the owner and administrator of the Brandon's Void website.

## Information Collected

The Site collects three types of information: information you volunteer, analytics, and advertising.
Any time you email me, that is a collection of information. It is a manual process. Otherwise, I do not ask the User of this Site to volunteer any information.
Advertising and Analytics information is collected automatically by the Google AdSense and Google Analytics platforms, respectively.

Google Analytics allows the Site to collect information that helps me understand how users use my site. This information includes: the time you visited, what pages you visited, the time spent on each page you visited, how you came onto the site (such as via a direct link or Google search), what type of web browser you used, what type of operating system (OS) you used, whether or not you have JavaScript enabled, what your screen resolution and color are, and finally, your network location and IP address.

Google AdSense serves advertisements. It uses cookies, strings of information affiliated with your browser, to serve ads based on prior visits to the Site and other websites. The use of advertising cookies allows Google and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Site and other sites on the internet. You can opt out of this advertising by declining the messages that first appear when you visit the site. You may also opt out of personalized advertising by visitng [Google Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com). You can also opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting [www.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). In addition, many browsers offer privacy options to prevent the use of cookies by advertisers and others.

In addition to Google AdSense, the Site uses third-party vendors and ad networks. You can find lists of those vendors at the following links:

* [https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/googleads-vendors](https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/googleads-vendors)

Using the provided links, you may opt out of advertising from these third-party vendors. Or use the previously mentioned [www.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

## Legal Basis for Collecting Information

My legal basis for collecting this information is necessity and consent, and necessity only applies to a very minute amount of the cookies the Site collects. If you do not want to be tracked, please visit the provided links, and please opt-out of cookies on this site. If you revoke your consent, the Site cannot and will not track you.

## Disclosure of Information

Other than myself, information collected automatically may also be shared with the previously mentioned third-parties.

I may also disclose information as required by the law. This means I may share information if the Site or myself is issued a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.

## Information Deletion

Information collected by the Site is deleted in a timely manner. Any information manually sent will be deleted as soon as the matter is resolved. Any information automatically collected is kept for two (2) months and then deleted. You can request your data be purged at any time, and to comply with California law, a page will be provided showing the number of purge requests from California residents. To submit a purge request, please contact me at brandon@brandonsvoid.com

## Privacy Policy Changes
Occasionally I may change this Privacy Policy. You will be notified of these changes.

## Cookie Policy

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer or device as text files and loaded into your browser. They are used to remember you and your preferences. For example, there is only one required cookie needed for you to use the Site. That is the cookie that stores your cookie preferences. Without this cookie, it would be impossible to follow the law. So, the Site collects this information and keeps it stored for 31 days. This cookie is identified as "cookie-notice-dismissed-bradonsvoid.com".

Analytics and advertising also use cookies. These cookies are optional.

## Advertising Cookies

Google AdSense and its third-part vendors use a number of cookies to track advertising served to users. You can opt-out of these cookies by visiting [Google Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com) and [www.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). You can also individually opt-out of cookies at the following two links provided by Google showcasing their third-party vendors:

These cookies include IDE and ANID, which are used to show ads on non-Google sites. ANID remembers your personalized ad settings. In the UK and European Economic Area (EEA), these cookies last for 13 months. Everywhere else they last for 24 months.

The DSID cookies is used to identify Google users on non-Google sites and lasts 2 weeks.

_gads is the cookie that enables the Site to show Google ads, including personalized ads. It lasts for 13 months.

Finally, some cookies are used to measure ad performance. _gcl cookies are responsible for this. They come from Google Analytics and help advertisers determine how many users who click on an ad end up taking an action on their site. This cookie lasts for 90 days.
