Hello! My name is Brandon, and I occasionally like to write my thoughts down. This blog acts as a sort of repository for those ideas and any projects I feel like putting on the web. What are those ideas and projects? I don't know! Sometimes, I just wanna write about something and put it somewhere. In that way, this site is kind of like an online journal that I'm letting whoever happens to wander by read.
